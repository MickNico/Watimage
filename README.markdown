#About
Watimage is a PHP class to resize, rotate and apply watermark to images.

It was initially thought as a CakePHP Component, so it's really easy to use it as is.


##Usage

### As standalone class

```php
require_once 'watimage.php';

$wm = new Watimage('test.png', 'watermark.png');

// Resize image to 400x400px
$wm->resize(array('type' => 'resizecrop', 'size' => 400));

// Flip it horitzontally
$wm->flip('horizontal');

// Rotate 90 degrees
$wm->rotate(90);

// Apply the watermark
$wm->applyWatermark();

// Generate and save image
if ( !$wm->generate('test6.png') ) {
	// handle errors...
	print_r($wm->errors);
}
```

### As a CakePHP Component

Before using Watimage as a CakePHP Component, you must uncoment this:

```php
class Watermark//Component extends Object
```

So that it is..

```php
class WatermarkComponent extends Object
```

Example Controller:

```php
class FooController extends AppController
{
	public $components = array(
		// You can set this later using setQuality()
		'Watimage' => array('quality' => 80)
	);
	
	public function bar()
	{
		// Set image and watermark
		$this->Watimage->setImage('test.png');
		$this->Watimage->setWatermark('watermark.png');

		// Resize image to 400x400px
		$this->Watimage->resize(array('type' => 'resizecrop', 'size' => 400));

		// Flip it horitzontally
		$this->Watimage->flip('horizontal');

		// Rotate 45 degrees
		$this->Watimage->rotate(45);

		// Apply the watermark
		$this->Watimage->applyWatermark();

		// Generate and save image
		if ( !$this->Watimage->generate('test6.png') ) {
			// handle errors...
			print_r($this->Watimage->errors);
		}
	}
}
```
